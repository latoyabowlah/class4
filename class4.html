     	<h1>Banana Bread Recipe</h1>

     	<p>No need for a mixer for this recipe! Clean-up is easy too, if you want, you can mix everything in one bowl.The best bananas to use for banana bread are those that are over-ripe. The yellow peels should be at least half browned, and the bananas inside  squishy and browning.</p>
